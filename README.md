## Technical choices:

**- Project creation:**
  
  I created the project using create next-app (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). The Next version used was 13, and the project uses the new concepts and features of this version.


**- Architecture**

  I divided the project in a way that it could be scalable. I preferred to create the components and the style in the same file, so that later maintenance would be easier.


**- Styles:**

  For the styling of the project, I used the **tailwindcss** framework. I really enjoyed using this framework, and it has a very good integration with the new features of NextJS.
  
  For some components, the hadlessUI library for React was used. This library is very easy to use, and has full integration with TailwindCSS for easy customization.


**- Code styling:**

  For pattern of project's code, I used the eslint and prettier libraries, so that coding rules and patterns could be implemented.


## Main technologies used in the project:

* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
* [TypesCript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
